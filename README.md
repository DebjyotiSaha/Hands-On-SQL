# Hands-On-SQL

This repository showcases my hands-on learning path towards mastering SQL. Here, I share the SQL queries, exercises, and projects I've worked on to understand various SQL concepts, including data manipulation, joins, aggregations, subqueries, and advanced SQL functions.

## Projects

- **Learning Day 1 to Day 6**: A series of exercises capturing essential SQL syntax and concepts, from basic SELECT queries to more advanced techniques.
- **Practice Queries**: Practical examples to solve real-world problems using SQL, demonstrating different types of joins, aggregations, window functions, and data analysis techniques.
- **Complex SQL Problem Solving**: Projects focused on handling large datasets, cleaning data, and performing complex analysis using SQL.

## Skills Learned

- SQL syntax and structure
- Data manipulation using SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE
- Joins, subqueries, and advanced SQL functions
- Window functions and CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Data analysis and reporting using SQL

## Repository Structure

- `Learning Day 1.sql`, `Learning Day 2.sql`, etc.: SQL queries and exercises from different learning days.
- `Hands-On-SQL.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing SQL queries and their explanations.

## Usage

To execute the SQL queries, you can use any relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.

Clone this repository and start running the queries to practice and improve your SQL skills.
